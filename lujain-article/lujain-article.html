               <div class="ticker_item">Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is
                the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between
                the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted. And
                while it is true that literature and history contain heroic, romantic, glorious,
                even triumphant episodes in an exile’s life, these are no more than efforts
                meant to overcome the crippling sorrow of estrangement. The achievements
                of exile are permanently undermined by the loss of something left behind
                forever. But if true exile is a condition of terminal loss, why has it been
                transformed so easily into a potent, even enriching, motif of modern culture?
                We have become accustomed to thinking of the modern period itself as
                spiritually orphaned and alienated, the age of anxiety and estrangement.
                Nietzsche taught us to feel uncomfortable with tradition, and Freud to regard
                domestic intimacy as the polite face painted on patricidal and incestuous rage.
                Modern Western culture is in large part the work of exiles, émigrés, refugees.
                In the United States, academic, intellectual and aesthetic thought is what it is
                today because of refugees from fascism, communism, and other regimes
                given to the oppression and expulsion of dissidents. The critic George Steiner
                has even proposed the perceptive thesis that a whole genre of twentiethcentury Western literature is “extraterritorial,” a literature by and about exiles,
                symbolizing the age of the refugee. Thus Steiner suggests:
                It seems proper that those who create art in a civilization of quasi-barbarism, which has made
                so many homeless, should themselves be poets unhoused and wanderers across language.
                Eccentric, aloof, nostalgic, deliberately untimely …
                In other ages, exiles had similar cross-cultural and transnational visions,
                suffered the same frustrations and miseries, performed the same elucidating
                and critical tasks—brilliantly affirmed, for instance, in E. H. Carr’s classic
                study of the nineteenth-century Russian intellectuals clustered around Herzen,
                The Romantic Exiles. But the difference between earlier exiles and those of
                our own time is, it bears stressing, scale: our age—with its modern warfare,
                imperialism, and the quasi-theological ambitions of totalitarian rulers—is
                indeed the age of the refugee, the displaced person, mass immigration.
                Against this large, impersonal setting, exile cannot be made to serve
                notions of humanism. On the twentieth-century scale, exile is neither
                aesthetically nor humanistically comprehensible: at most the literature about
                exile objectifies an anguish and a predicament most people rarely experience
                first hand; but to think of the exile informing this literature as beneficially
                humanistic is to banalize its mutilations, the losses it inflicts on those who
                suffer them, the muteness with which it responds to any attempt to understand
                it as “good for us.” Is it not true that the views of exile in literature and,
                moreover, in religion obscure what is truly horrendous: that exile is
                irremediably secular and unbearably historical; that it is produced by human
                beings for other human beings; and that, like death but without death’s
                ultimate mercy, it has torn millions of people from the nourishment of
                tradition, familsy, and geography?</div>

                <div style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 10px;">
                <p>Growing up, I was not exposed to much literature or films on the Palestinian experience; my understanding of it — culturally, politically, and personally — was limited. But, attending a diverse educational institution for my undergraduate degree propelled me towards Palestinian literature, cinema, and poetry in a desperate attempt to make sense of my Palestinianess. Of course, that process was not exempt from Edward Said’s seminal thoughts and essays. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edward Said was a Palestinian-American intellectual and a professor at Columbia University who was one of the pioneers of the field of postcolonial studies. Said wrote extensively on his <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~germ43/pdfs/said_reflections.pdf">experience being exiled</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="https://janeaustensummer.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/culture_and_imperialism.pdf">on culture and imperialism</a>, on <a  target="_blank" href="https://monoskop.org/images/4/4e/Said_Edward_Orientalism_1979.pdf">orientalism</a>, and on the <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406648?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">question of Palestine</a>. Unlike Said, I did not experience exile first hand but was instead born into it. I also grew up with the internet and on the internet, thus, at times, was negotiating barriers and accessabilities of a different kind. Yet, it struck me how relevant and personal Said’s writing felt; even though it was highly specific at times, it was still applicable now, decades later, when my generation’s experience of exile is largely shaped and mediated by a different “world”: the internet. </p>
                </div>
                </div>
            <div class="column">
                <div style="margin-right: 40px; margin-left: 10px;">
                <p>Of course, this applicability is in large part due to the still ongoing Palestinian struggle, but is also due to the reality that the internet is not as different a world as we think or would like it to be. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is true that many of the challenges exiles experience have eased due to the internet’s facilitation, Said’s articulation of these challenges still deeply resonate with my understanding and observations — as an exile and technologist myself — of the ways the internet is and is not allowed to work. Ultimately, the internet is just another human invention, enabled and flawed by the same humans and systems which create and support it. In an attempt to reconcile how the ideas Said reflects on in his writing — including mobility, language, and solitude — manifest, rather than disappear, on the internet, both algorithmically and socially, I present in this article a brief “internet” reading of Said’s essay "<a  target="_blank" href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~germ43/pdfs/said_reflections.pdf">Reflections on Exile.</a>" This reading, like the original essay, is a personal reflection that is ripe with facts, opinions, and questions in place of answers. </p>

        <h3>On Mobility and Immobility</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; "><b>“Borders and barriers, which enclose us within the safety of familiar territory, can also become prisons, and are often defended beyond reason or necessity. Exiles cross borders, break barriers of thought and experience.” - E. Said
    </b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <div style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 10px;">
                <p>Negotiating borders and barriers is an inevitable reality for exiles. Those include language barriers, cultural and religious barriers, country borders, and more. With time, and over generations of exile, some barriers become more prominent than others. Ideally, on the internet, lots of these barriers are meant to be broken: we can access information and connect in many forms to different points all around the world. What this means is that I can have access to my exilic homeland and the people of my exilic homeland can also have access to me via the thoughts and media we can share online. All of this can alleviate the overwhelming feeling of estrangement that is at the center of the exilic experience. However, realistically, while the internet removes many barriers, it still allows many others to exist and even thrive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One important barrier is language as we experience the internet <a  target="_blank" href="http://labs.theguardian.com/digital-language-divide/">differently</a> depending on the language(s) we operate in. Many diasporic communities no longer operate in their native tongues — at least not online, especially if they speak English, a lingua franca — and thus cannot afford this ease of access to the content and people of their exilic homelands, who still largely operate in their native tongues, and vice versa. <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/view/2856/3250">Studies</a> have shown that Twitter users largely restrict their interactions to those who speak the same languages as them. Thus, our ideas and thoughts are mostly restricted to those of us who are similarly a part of the diaspora, and how much we actually know about the experiences and thoughts of the people in our exilic homelands is quite limited.

                <p>
                    Content moderation and recommendation systems are additional examples of barriers that exist in cyberspace. Whether it’s actual human beings as moderators or machine learning algorithms,

                    social media companies seem to have repeatedly <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwk9zd/how-facebook-content-moderation-works">failed</a> to appropriately moderate content, while simultaneously not violating people’s democatric rights to freely speak. Facebook, for instance, is <a  target="_blank" href="https://7amleh.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/booklet-final2-1.pdf">notorious</a> for taking down Palestinian accounts and content, let alone promoting them to us in our feeds. Twitter is no <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2019/11/03/journalists-accuse-twitter-of-censorship-as-it-suspends-multiple-news-accounts-from-palestine-and-lebanon/">saint</a> when it comes to this either. Just a few months ago, supermodel Bella Hadid had Instagram <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/15/bella-hadid-deleted-instagram-post-palestinians-silenced">remove</a> a post of her father’s passport, which states his birthplace as Palestine, claiming that the simple father’s day post violates their community guidelines on harassment and bullying. Following this incident, Hadid publicly called out the platform: </p>
                    <blockquote><i>Are we not allowed to be Palestinian on Instagram? This, to me, is bullying. You can’t erase history by silencing people. It doesn’t work like that.</i></blockquote>
                        
                    <p>This pushed Instagram to apologize to Hadid and explain that it was a “mistake” meant to protect the privacy of their users even though the picture she shared had the passport number blurred out. 
                    </p>
           <p> While social media platforms are working hard to tackle misinformation, credibility, and privacy concerns, it is often at the expense of already marginalized communities as well as at the expense of <a  target="_blank" href="https://misinfocon.com/citizen-journalism-could-become-collateral-damage-in-the-fight-against-fake-news-c93658a59fd4">credible citizen journalism</a>. This selective censorship — both explicit through removing content and implicit through recommendation algorithms — limits what we are allowed to be exposed to and what we are not and forms remarkable barriers that restrict mobility in cyberspace.

        <h3>On the Privileges and Benefits of Exile</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; "><b>“I speak of exile not as a privilege, but as an alternative to the mass institutions that dominate modern life. Exile is not, after all, a matter of choice: you are born into it, or it happens to you. But, provided that the exile refuses to sit on the sidelines nursing a wound, there are things to be learned: he or she must cultivate a scrupulous (not indulgent or sulky) subjectivity.” - E. Said</b></p>
    </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <div style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 10px;">
                    <p>One could argue that “learning” is no longer attached to physical mobility. In other words, this privilege of learning that was previously attached, at least to the one-time, physical mobility that is afforded to exiles is no longer that exclusive a privilege given the internet’s facilitation of information access. There is no denying that the internet has provided us with a never-ending bank of knowledge. However, firstly, this assumes everyone has equal access or has access at all — a naive and faulty assumption given that only approximately <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">59%</a> of the global population actually has internet access. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if one does have access, not all “accesses” are created equal. Wherever we are in the world, we cannot ignore the <a  target="_blank" href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/1998-99/nuremberg-files/censorship.html">role</a> of the privately, governmentally, or publicly owned organizations through which we access the internet, also known as internet service providers (ISPs), in mediating our access to information by censoring and blocking different sites and to different extents when convenient. In Palestine, after one ISP became a monopoly in 2005, Israeli authorities <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24877901?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">required</a> it to provide limited bandwidth and at a high cost for Palestinian internet use compared to ISPs in Israel. This not only hinders Palestinians’ access to the internet due to speed and cost, but also deprives Palestinians from building their own internet infrastructure, thus restricting their digital mobility in a targeted manner and to an extent that we do not experience as exiles in other countries. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the undeniable digital language divide means that depending on the language you operate in, your access to information through Google searches or social media searches is a very different experience compared to others who operate in a different language. Different is not always good — especially if you do not speak English.
                        </p>
                </div>
                </div>
            <div class="column">
                <div style="margin-right: 40px; margin-left: 10px;">
               <p> An Oxford <a  target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/a44674">study</a> by Mark Graham and Matthew Zook on Google searches in the West Bank shows that searches in Arabic usually result in only 20% to 25% of the number of results the same search term brings in English. At a time when most of our information has migrated to the digital sphere, the privilege of speaking a Western language online, which many, but of course not all, exiles do, is quite notable. 
               </p>
               <p>
                While it helps to separate what is online from what is offline, the line between the two is as blurry as ever as we use the internet to guide even the smallest of our daily activities. The same study I reference above also shows that a search for the word “restaurant” on Google maps using three different languages (Arabic, English, and Hebrew) leads users to different parts of the same city for dining options. Additionally, in Palestine, while the drive from Ramallah to Nablus takes 45 minutes, Google maps instead <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCswzsvJPXK/">suggests</a> a 4 hour drive through Israeli roads. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These examples of oppression embedded in the economy and infrastructure of the internet show how imperialist structures are allowed to thrive online, and consequently in real life, unchecked and targeting communities in a reinvented colonialism: cyber colonialism. Some of these infringements on internet and information access, which the UN <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7">deems</a> a “fundamental human right,” are a serious concern. </p>

        <h3>On Nationalisms and Solitudes</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; "><b>“Nationalisms are about groups, but in a very acute sense exile is a solitude experienced outside the group: the deprivations felt at not being with others in the communal habituation… The exile is offered a new set of affiliations and develops new loyalties. But there is also a loss of critical perspective, of intellectual reserve, of moral courage… Exiles look at non-exiles with resentment. They belong in their surroundings, you feel, whereas an exile is always out of place. What is it like to be born in a place, to stay and live there, to know that you are of it, more or less, forever?” - E. Said
    </b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <div style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 10px;">
                <p>These new sets of “affiliations” and “loyalties,” based on experiences that transcend nationalisms, can be understood through “<a  target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@oliconner/key-concept-structure-of-feeling-42fecc8f7430">structures of feelings</a>” rather than the solidity of nationalisms. They also eventually create groups of their own. A simple manifestation of this is the concept of allyship and solidarity that has grown in popularity and impact with the growth of the internet and globalization. For instance, a loyalty to justice can be a shared loyalty among different peoples from all around the world. The internet, like social media, allows us to better realize these shared values among exilic, refugee, and marginalized communities globally. The African American struggle in the United States is <a  target="_blank" href="https://mondoweiss.net/2017/05/historical-palestinian-solidarity/">undoubtedly</a> tied to the Palestinian struggle and the internet makes it easier to see that, participate in it, and form a new sense of belonging to something that, unlike nationalisms, is not as strictly territorially bound. 
                </p>
            </div>
            </div>
        <div class="column">
            <div style="margin-right: 40px; margin-left: 10px;">
           <p> Another example is the literal creation of “groups”, like Facebook <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/subtle-asian-traits-subtle-curry-traits-take-over-the-internet/10558888">meme groups</a>, based on shared cultural and lived experiences, that once again the internet allows us to discover and participate in. Some of these groups, like Subtle Asian Traits and Subtle Curry Traits, create a sense of belonging centered on the diasporic experience. As human nature has us continually searching for some kind of feeling of belonging that, as Said describes it, fulfils this “deprivation” of not physically being with others who share “similar” experiences, the internet allows us to creatively and at a much larger scale explore and form new “affiliations.”
           </p>
            </div>
            </div>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
        <h3>On New Worlds</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; "><b>“Much of the exile’s life is taken up with compensating for disorienting loss by creating a new world to rule… Seeing “the entire world as a foreign land” makes possible originality of vision.”- E. Said
    </b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
    <p>
    While there’s a long way to go in creating an open and inclusive internet, I cannot deny what this new world has given me and many others: the ability to see photos of Palestine literally taken today within a few clicks, the ability to call family I’m separated from with a single link, and the ability to participate in what aspires to be a campaign of constant communication and education. But, as we experience the extremes of the benefits and injustices of the internet, perhaps this “originality of vision” we might have acquired can help us create a new, healthy internet to rule.
